# Introduction {#introduction}

This document describes how the RH4131 database is converted to the OMOP Common
Data Model (CDM) version 5.4.1. It describes the definition of the ETL that will
be used in the implementation. 

RH4131 has requested support from edenceHealth to extract, transform and load
historical data in the context of a first "pilot" project. This project will
serve as a stepping stone to larger future projects that include building and
maintaining a Danish national data warehouse to house real-world evidence. The
pilot project of historical data contains ICU data from 10 hospitals.
edenceHealth will co-develop an ETL for ICU data from 3 hospitals as a template
for RH4131.

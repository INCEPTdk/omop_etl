# Vocabularies {#vocabulary-mapping}

In this section, an overview is provided of the vocabulary mapping step.  

The following source code vocabularies are present in the database:

    -   Vocabulary 
    -   Reference Link 
    -   Description 
    -   Data Domains

    -   SKS

    -
    -   drug_exposure

    -   NPU
    -   https://npu-terminology.org/
    -   The source data use NPU codes for biochemical analyses of biological
        samples (blood, plasma, urin, spinal fluid, etc.). Patient-level NPU
        data will, in the end, not be available for this pilot project, but we
        will undertake semantic mapping of the 200 most common NPU codes so
        these are ready for structural mapping once possible.
    -   measurement
